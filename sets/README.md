# Sets Data Structure

A set is an abstract data type that can store certain values, without any particular order and no repeated values. It is a computer implementation of the mathematical concept of a finite set. Unlike most other collection types, rather than retrieving a specific element from a set, one typically tests a value for membership in a set.

The typical use case of a set is to check the presence of an item.
